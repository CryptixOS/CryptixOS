# 🧬 CryptixOS

**CryptixOS** is a modern, modular, Unix-like operating system for `x86_64` and `aarch64`, written entirely in C++. It features its own kernel, standard library (`Prism`), and build system. Designed for clarity, extensibility, and education, CryptixOS serves as a powerful base for learning OS development or building your own custom system from scratch.

# 🔥 Motivation & Goals
CryptixOS was created out of curiosity and a desire to understand how modern operating systems work—from kernel bootstrapping and memory management to user-facing system calls. The goal is to build a modular, maintainable, and educational operating system from scratch, with clean C++ abstractions, not just C.

This project is ideal for:
* Learning OS design (kernel, memory, file systems, drivers, scheduling, etc.)
* Experimenting with low-level C++ in a systems context
* Building an actual custom OS on real or emulated hardware

# ⚙️ Architecture Overview
CryptixOS is a monolithic kernel designed for the x86_64 architecture. It features:
* Physical & virtual memory manager with paging and kernel heap allocation
* Custom C++ STL-like containers (vector, string, intrusive list, unordered map)
* Virtual filesystem layer with support for ext2 and shmem
* ELF loading and execution for userland programs
* Syscall interface for user-kernel communication
* Multithreading and scheduling with future plans for SMP
* Basic device drivers: PS/2, serial, VGA, RTC, PCI, etc.
* It uses its own standard library (Prism) and custom build tools.

# 🚀 Build & Run Instructions
## 🛠 Prerequisites
Make sure the following tools are installed on your system:
- C++20 compiler (GCC or Clang)
- NASM (for low-level assembly)
- QEMU (or Bochs) for emulation
- Meson + Ninja (build system)
- xbstrap + Python 3 (for sysroot management)
- xorriso (for ISO image creation)

## 📦 Setting Up the Sysroot
Before building the kernel, you need to build the system root (toolchain and base packages). Here's how:
```
mkdir build-sysroot       # Create a directory for the sysroot
cd build-sysroot          # Enter it
xbstrap init ..           # Initialize xbstrap using the main repo
xbstrap install base      # Build and install base packages
```
This step ensures you have the tools and libraries needed for building the OS.

## 🧱 Building the Kernel & Image
Once the sysroot is ready:
```
./Meta/setup.sh <x86_64|aarch64>   # Configure for your target architecture
./Meta/build.sh                    # Build the kernel and generate a bootable .iso
```

## 💻 Running in an Emulator
To run CryptixOS in QEMU:
```
./Meta/run.sh <run_uefi|run_bios>
```
- Use run_uefi to boot via UEFI.
- Use run_bios for BIOS boot (x86_64 only).
